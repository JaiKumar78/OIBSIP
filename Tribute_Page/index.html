                    Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic Christian home, sharing a room with all his siblings.

                    As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy. By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a student and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he didn't complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.
                
                    Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (123) and international appearances (200). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the highest goal-scorer of all time according to the IFFHS. He is the only player to score in five different FIFA World Cup tournaments.

                    Ronaldo grew up in Madeira, Portugal, but after graduating from Sporting CP's youth system, he was immediately signed by Manchester United after their legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson noticed his winger talent. Ronaldo spent six years at Manchester United, where he honed his skills as a skilled, fast, and lethal winger capable of scoring goals and creating chances for his teammates.
                    Before moving to Real Madrid as the world's most expensive player, he won numerous trophies for Manchester United and even shone for Portugal. He has smashed some of the most important goal-scoring records in Real Madrid's history, as well as leading the club to significant trophies.
                    Ronaldo also serves as the captain of the Portuguese national team, which won Euro 2016 for the first time in their history. He has also received numerous individual awards, confirming his status as one of the world's best footballers.

                    Cristiano Ronaldo marked his 1,000th professional game this weekend by scoring in a record-equalling 11th Serie A game in a row, as Juventus moved four points clear at the top of the table. Here we count down 10 of his greatest performances:

                    <h3>10) SPORTING 3-0 Moreirense, Primeira Liga 7 October 2002</h3>
                    At just 17 years of age, Ronaldo made his debut for Sporting Lisbon in a convincing 3-0 win against Moreirense. It was a dream senior debut for the teenager, who scored twice in what was a poor Sporting side who would go on to finish third in the Primeira Liga, some 27 points behind champions Benfica. Very few at the time would have thought that the youngster would go on to become one of the games greatest players, but it was here that Ronaldo first made his mark on the footballing world.

                    <h3>9) Juventus 1-4 REAL MADRID, Champions League final, 3 June 2017</h3>
                    After a quiet start, Ronaldo came alive to level the game, exchanging passes with Dani Carvajal down the right before drilling a low shot which was too powerful for Gianluigi Buffon. He was not done there; midway through the second half, Luka Modric chipped the ball to the near post where Cristiano had darted to score his 600th career goal, and seal back-to-back European Cups.

                    <h3>8) Barcelona 1-2 REAL MADRID, La Liga, 21 April 2012</h3>
                    It will be remembered by many Real Madrid fans as the day that Ronaldo silenced the Camp Nou crowd with his famous “Calma” celebration. In a tense and nervy affair, Ronaldo scored the winner in the late stages of the game as Real beat Barca to end any hopes of a Catalan title pursuit. Ronaldo was crucial in helping Real to their first title in four years in a season where he scored 60 goals in all-competitions, including a staggering 46 league goals. It was also a record-breaking year for Real as they reached 100 points.

                    <h3>7) Juventus 0-3 REAL MADRID, Champions League quarter-finals, 3 April 2018</h3>
                    Ronaldo scored twice including an incredible bicycle kick to help Real Madrid breeze past Juventus in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. He made history with the first of his two goals on the night, becoming the first player to score in 10 consecutive Champions League games. However, his overhead kick remains the night’s key talking point, forever being remembered as one of the Champions League’s greatest goals. The effort left Gianluigi Buffon with absolutely no chance and was so spectacular that many home fans stood to applaud.

                    <h3>6) PORTUGAL 3-3 Spain, World Cup, 15 June 2018</h3>
                    This was the game that really set the tournament alight in Russia: a dramatic 3-3 draw between Portugal and Spain courtesy of a stunning display by who else but Ronaldo. He opened the scoring in the fourth minute with a penalty, before scoring again shortly before the break with a strike that was too powerful for David de Gea. His fantastic late free-kick, curled over the wall and into the top corner, completed his hat-trick and rescued a point for Portugal in what was their opening group match. In doing so, Ronaldo became only the fourth player to score in four consecutive World Cups, after Pele, Uwe Seeler and Miroslav Klose.

                    <h3>5) REAL MADRID 4-2 Bayern Munich, Champions League quarter-finals, 18 April 2017</h3>
                    In a match marked by controversy, Ronaldo reached 100 Champions League goals courtesy of a hat-trick in a 4-2 win against Bayern Munich. His treble helped the defending champions to a resounding 6-3 aggregate victory, as the Spanish giants reached the semi-final for the seventh consecutive year. It looked as if Ronaldo had won the game with his 76th-minute header before Sergio Ramos put through his own net to send the game to extra time. But Ronaldo was the star of the show once again scoring two more goals, with his left and right foot respectively, to complete the perfect hat-trick.

                    <h3>4) Arsenal 1-3 MANCHESTER UNITED, Champions League semi-finals, 5 May 2009</h3>
                    Arguably Ronaldo’s greatest performance in a Manchester United shirt, given the opposition and the stage. The tie was in the balance after a 1-0 victory for United at Old Trafford in the first leg, but the Portuguese took the game away from Arsenal within 11 minutes, first setting up Ji-Sung Park before arrowing in a stunning free-kick from 35 yards. He added another in the second half after a blistering counter-attack to book United’s place in the final.

                    <h3>3) REAL MADRID 3-0 Wolfsburg, Champions League quarter-finals, 12 April 2016</h3>
                    In Real Madrid’s hour of need, up stepped Ronaldo, scoring a hat-trick at the Bernabeu to turn around a 2-0 deficit from the first leg. The first two came in less than a minute to suddenly draw the game level, before a 25-yard free-kick which had an air of inevitability as soon as he stepped up. Madrid went on to clinch their 11th Champions League crown.

                    <h3>2) Sweden 2-3 PORTUGAL, World Cup qualifying play-offs, 19 November 2013</h3>
                    In what was one of his greatest performances for his country, Cristiano scored an incredible hat-trick in a 3-2 win against Sweden at the Friends Arena in Stockholm. In the battle between Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic, which saw both players score all of the tie’s goals, it was Cristiano who stole the show to help Portugal clinch their place in Brazil with a 4-2 aggregate win. With the scores level at half-time, Ronaldo took centre stage in what was a brilliant second-half display, with three powerful finishes on the break. It was also memorable night for the captain as he became Portugal’s all-time leading goalscorer, with 50 goals, surpassing retired forward Pauleta’s 47.

                    <h3>1) JUVENTUS 3-0 Atletico Madrid, Champions League round of 16, 12 March 2019</h3>
                    It what he described as a “magical night”, Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick against Atletico Madrid for Juventus was inconceivable. After being outclassed at the Wanda Metropolitano in the first leg, losing 2-0, an angry Ronaldo left the stadium holding up five fingers to remind critics of his Champions League medal count. Juve needed something special to overturn the tie and progress to the next stage. Up stepped Ronaldo, as he so often does to single-handily send the Old Lady into the quarter-final. In the first half he headed home at the far post, before a second-half header was awarded courtesy of goal-line technology, and he completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot. Simply extraordinary.

                    Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum
                    At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[27] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[19] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[28] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[29] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.

                    <h3>Manchester United</h3>

                    2003–2007: Development and breakthrough
                    "There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me."

                    —Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[34]
                    Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[35] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[36] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[37] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[38] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career

                    <h3>Real Madrid</h3>

                    Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million (€94 million).[112] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[113] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[114] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[115] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[116]

                    <h3>Juventus</h3>

                    Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[231] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs.[232] The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[233] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[234] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[235] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez

                    <h3>Return to Manchester United</h3>

                    2021–2022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles
                    On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[289] The transfer was for an initial £12.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.[290] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[291] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[292]


                    Ronaldo in a Premier League match against Newcastle in September 2021, his first game back at Manchester United
                    On 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.[293] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[294] In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3–2 home victory against Atalanta,[295] and scored both goals, including a last minute equalizer, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November.[296] On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2–0 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners.[297] On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals

                    <h3>Al Nassr</h3>

                   On 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.[327] As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth €200 million per year;[328][329] this included an annual guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to €200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of €100 million.[330] According to Romano, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.[331] Ronaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1–0 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022.
